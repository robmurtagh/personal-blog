Last year I came across the Recurse Centre's [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules)\* document. Working with computers it's easy to get carried away with the incidental complexity of our day-to-day work. I've found that too often it's easy to slip into type of discourse which at best you could call 'unproductive'.

I really liked how these social rules neatly and concretely capture a number of behaviours are self-evidently unproductive and unsupportive. As a brief summary, their rules are:

- No well-actually's
- No feigned surprise
- No backseat driving
- No subtle -isms

But really, I'd encourage you to [read them for yourself](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules).

\* I came across the social rules in the [code of conduct](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/code-of-conduct) for Josh Comeau's excellent [CSS-for-JS](https://css-for-js.dev/) course. I'd recommend it to anyone!
